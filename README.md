# Strategic Data Insights: Evaluating Target’s Performance in Brazil
### Project Overview
This project, titled “Strategic Data Insights: Evaluating Target’s Performance in Brazil,” presents a comprehensive analysis of operational data from Target's Brazilian market. The dataset spans from 2016 to 2018 and includes 100,000 orders, split into eight CSV files covering customers, sellers, order items, geolocation, payments, orders, products, and customer reviews.

The aim is to derive valuable insights through multi-level queries, covering a wide range of business aspects such as order processing, pricing, payment methods, shipping performance, customer demographics, product attributes, and customer satisfaction. These insights can help enhance Target's strategic decision-making in the Brazilian market, leading to improved business performance and customer satisfaction.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following eight CSV files:

customers.csv
sellers.csv
order_items.csv
geolocation.csv
payments.csv
orders.csv
products.csv
customer_reviews.csv
This dataset covers 100,000 orders between 2016 and 2018, providing a detailed view of the business's operational performance.

### Queries and Insights
### Basic Queries
List all unique cities where customers are located.
Count the number of orders placed in 2017.
Find the total sales per category.
Calculate the percentage of orders that were paid in installments.
Count the number of customers from each state.
### Intermediate Queries
Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018.
Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.
Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.
Identify the correlation between product price and the number of times a product has been purchased.
Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller, and rank them by revenue.
### Advanced Queries
